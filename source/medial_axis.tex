\section{The Medial Axis}
This section begins to lay the foundation to prove that the crust is a valid method to reconstruct a curve, with a few interesting results along the way. First, I will define the medial axis, but intuitively it can be thought of as a Voronoi diagram for an infinite set of points \cite{AMENTA1998125}.
