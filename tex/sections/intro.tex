\section{Introduction and Background}

Describe the analysis of algorithms

Define curve reconstruction

give examples why connecting points to the nearest neighbor isn't good

Maybe define "general position"

The crust method of curve reconstruction builds on a few basic geometric tools that are used constantly in discrete geometry in a wide degree of applications. The following sections introduce these tools and prove numerous important and interesting results about them.
