    abstract = {We construct a graph on a planar point set, which captures its
                shape in the following sense: if a smooth curve is sampled
                densely enough, the graph on the samples is a polygonalization of
                the curve, with no extraneous edges. The required sampling
                density varies with thelocal feature sizeon the curve, so that
                areas of less detail can be sampled less densely. We give two
                different graphs that, in this sense, reconstruct smooth curves:
                a simple new construction which we call thecrust, and the
                β-skeleton, using a specific value of β.},
